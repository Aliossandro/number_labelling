# Multi-level Semantic Labelling of Numerical Values
*Sebastian Neumaier, Jürgen Umbrich, Josiane Xavier Parreira, and Axel Polleres*

We apply a hierarchical clustering over information taken from DBpedia to build a background knowledge graph of possible “semantic contexts” for bags of numerical values, over which we perform a nearest neighbour search to rank the most likely candidates.
